# Asserts that CI still runs the shell suite, and that nothing it gates has
# quietly stopped being gated.
#
# Every host-side guarantee this repo makes rests on four facts about
# .github/workflows/, and until this file none of them was checked by anything:
#
#   1. build.yml's `Shell tests` job runs ./tests/run-tests.sh
#   2. coverage-gate.yml runs the same suite on the complement of build.yml's
#      paths-ignore, so a docs-only change is verified by something
#   3. both jobs install shellcheck *before* running the suite, which is what
#      makes test-shell-syntax.sh's shellcheck pass enforced rather than
#      skipped (that test skips it when the tool is absent, by design)
#   4. build_push has `needs: tests`, so a red suite blocks the image build
#
# Delete the tests job, drop `needs: tests`, drop the shellcheck install, or add
# a path to paths-ignore without adding it to coverage-gate.yml, and the suite
# stays green while the gate stops gating. test-coverage.sh does not catch it:
# it asserts a coverage *decision* exists for every shipped script, not that the
# decision is enforced anywhere.
#
# The path filters are the sharp case. A workflow that stops running is not a
# workflow that fails — the run that would have gone red is the run that no
# longer starts — so a paths-ignore that grows a third entry produces a green CI
# result on the very change that stopped covering that path.
#
# Only one direction of the path relation is asserted: every path build.yml
# ignores must appear in coverage-gate.yml for the same event. The reverse does
# not hold and should not. coverage-gate.yml also triggers on '**/README.md',
# which build.yml ignores on push but not on pull_request, so a pull request
# touching only tests/README.md runs the suite twice. Both workflows' comments
# call that trade deliberate, so the assertion is a superset check rather than
# equality.
#
# What runs this test matters as much as what it asserts. A `pull_request` run
# executes the *head* branch's copy of a workflow file — measured on this repo
# and written up in docs/SECURITY-AI.md — so a pull request that deletes the
# `Shell tests` job from build.yml is checked by the build.yml that no longer
# has it. The suite that would have gone red is the suite that no longer runs,
# and build_push proceeds. A test living inside the workflow it polices cannot
# close that on its own.
#
# So coverage-gate.yml triggers on '.github/workflows/**' as well, and this file
# asserts that it does. Any workflow edit is then checked by a workflow the pull
# request did not touch, and the two files police each other: build.yml runs the
# suite on a change to coverage-gate.yml, and coverage-gate.yml runs it on a
# change to build.yml. Disabling the gate takes an edit to both in one pull
# request rather than one line in one file. The last step — making that
# impossible rather than merely conspicuous — is a required status check in
# branch protection, which no file in the tree can assert.
#
# One assertion here is about a different property than the rest: that no step
# splices a ${{ ... }} expression into the shell it runs. That is not a gating
# question, it is the same anti-rot question in the security direction -- the
# safe form and the injectable form look identical in review, so the difference
# has to be checked rather than remembered. See section 6.
#
# The YAML is read with an indentation-anchored parser rather than a real one:
# CONTRIBUTING.md asks for a conversation before adding a dependency, and the
# structure needed here is shallow. The risk of hand-parsing is silent
# under-extraction — a reformat the parser cannot follow yields an empty result,
# and an assertion over nothing passes. So every extraction is checked for
# emptiness first and fails loudly, and each parser helper is exercised against
# a fixture with a known answer before it is trusted against the real files.
